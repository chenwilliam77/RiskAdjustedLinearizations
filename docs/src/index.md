# [RiskAdjustedLinearizations.jl](@id Home)

This package provides a user-friendly API for efficiently calculating risk-adjusted linearizations
of dynamic economic models. These linearizations are equivalent
to first-order perturbations around the stochastic steady state and are solved
by computing affine approximations.
