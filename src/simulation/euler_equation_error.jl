calculates standard Euler equation errors, as recommended by Judd (1992).
The first method calculates the error at some state `z‚Çú`, which defaults
to the stochastic steady state. The second method simulates the state
vector from an initial state `z‚Çú` (defaults to stochastic steady state)
given a sequence of drawn shocks, evaluates the Euler equation errors,
and returns some summary statistic of the errors specified by the keyword
`summary_statistic`.

The Euler equation is

```math
\\begin{aligned}
0 = \\log \\mathbb{E}_t \\exp(m_{t + 1} + r_{t + 1}) = \\log \\mathbb{E}_t[M_{t + 1} R_{t + 1}],
\\end{aligned}
```

where ``m_{t + 1} = \\log(M_{t + 1})`` is the log stochastic discount factor and ``r_{t + 1} = \\log(R_{t + 1})``
is the risk free rate.

### Inputs
- `m::RiskAdjustedLinearization`: A solved instance of a risk-adjusted linearization
- `c‚Çú::Function`: a function of `(m, z‚Çú)` that calculates consumption at state `z‚Çú`, given the
    state-space representation implied by `m`.
- `logSDFxR::Function`: a `Function` evaluating ``m_{t + 1} + r_{t + 1}``. The `Function` must
    take as input `(m, z‚Çú, Œµ‚Çú‚Çä‚ÇÅ, c)`, where `m` is a `RiskAdjustedLinearization`,
    `z‚Çú` is a state vector at which to evaluate, `Œµ‚Çú‚Çä‚ÇÅ` is a draw from the distribution
    of exogenous shocks, and `c` is a guess for consumption at `z‚Çú` implied by
    the conditional expectation in the Euler equation when calculated with a quadrature rule.
    Note that `c` can be either the consumption level or some transformation (e.g. log consumption),
    but the user should be consistent in the definition of the `c‚Çú` function with the guess `c`,
    i.e. both should return the same transformation of consumption (e.g. both should return the level).
- `ùîº_quadrature::Function`: a quadrature rule whose single input is a `Function` with a single
    input, which is a shock `Œµ‚Çú‚Çä‚ÇÅ`.
- `z‚Çú::AbstractVector`: a state at which to evaluate the Euler equation error
- `shock_matrix::Abstractmatrix`: a `NŒµ √ó T` matrix of shocks drawn from the distribution of exogenous shocks.

### Keywords
- `c_init::Number`: an initial guess to be used when solving the "true" consumption policy using
    quadrature. The default is the consumption policy according to the `RiskAdjustedLinearization`
- `summary_statistic::Function`: a `Function` used to compute a summary statistic from the
    ergodic set of Euler equation errors. The default is the maximum absolute error.
- `burnin::Int`: number of periods to drop as burn-in
- `kwargs`: Any keyword arguments for `nlsolve` can be passed, too, e.g. `ftol` or `autodiff`
    since `nlsolve` is used to calculate the "true" consumption policy.

```
calculates dynamic Euler equation errors, as proposed in Den Haan (2009).
The Euler equation is

``math
\\begin{aligned}
0 = \\log \\mathbb{E}_t \\exp(m_{t + 1} + r_{t + 1}) = \\log \\mathbb{E}_t[M_{t + 1} R_{t + 1}],
\\end{aligned}
``

where ``m_{t + 1} = \\log(M_{t + 1})`` is the log stochastic discount factor and ``r_{t + 1} = \\log(R_{t + 1})``
is the risk free rate.

The dynamic errors are computed according the following algorithm.

1. Simulate according to the risk-adjusted linearization time series for the state variables
2. Using the time series from 1, compute time series for consumption and
    some state variable (usually capital) that can ensure budget constraints hold and markets
    clear when computing consumption by applying quadrature.
3. Generate a second "implied" time series for consumption and the "capital" state variable,
    starting from the same initial state as 2. Repeat the following steps at each time period.
    (i)  Compute the conditional expectation in the Euler equation using quadrature to
         obtain implied consumption.
    (ii) Use budget constraint/market-clearing to compute implied capital.

By default, `dynamic_euler_equation_error` returns some summary statistic of the errors
specified by the keyword `summary_statistic`.

- `c‚Çú::Function`: a function of `(m, z‚Çú)` that calculates consumption at state `z‚Çú`, given the

    `z‚Çú` is a state vector at which to evaluate, `Œµ‚Çú‚Çä‚ÇÅ` is a draw from the distribution
    of exogenous shocks, and `c‚Çú` is the a guess for consumption at `z‚Çú` implied by
    the conditional expectation in the Euler equation when calculated with a quadrature rule.
- `ùîº_quadrature::Function`: a quadrature rule whose single input is a `Function` with a single
    input, which is a shock `Œµ‚Çú‚Çä‚ÇÅ`.
- `endo_states::Function`: augments the state variables in the risk-adjusted linearization,
    usually with one additional variable, which represents capital or assets.
- `n_aug::Int`: number of extra state variables added by `endo_states` (usually 1).
- `z‚Çú::AbstractVector`: a state at which to evaluate the Euler equation error
- `shock_matrix::Abstractmatrix`: a `NŒµ √ó T` matrix of shocks drawn from the distribution of exogenous shocks.
